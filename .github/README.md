About the game.
--
This is a 2-dimentional sapce game made using the SumoDigital PlayBuffer.
The aim is to fly through space, land on asteroids, detroy them, and collect gems to complete Agent8's mission. 
Throughout, the player must also dodge the firey meteros to stay alive.

For my own take on this game, I made it a story driven game to help set out the different stages and give a background to the character.
This helped me to give structure to the game and add different stages to the "mission".

There are two parts to the game play. 
The first objective is to destroy the 6 asteroids by jumping from them and collecting the gems which are left behind by flying into them.
Once all the gems are collected, the player is then instructed to destroy the meteors to finish off the game.

Features Of The Game.

Player Movement: Using space to push the player forward in the direction they are facing. Then, the left and right arrow keys change the players rotation to allow them to go in any direction.

Particle effects: There are a few different particle effects used to help visualise when a particualr action has taken place. For example, then the player leaves an asteroid, shards of the asteroid can be seen dispersing before disapearing
to signify that it has been destroyed. There is also a blue ring which appears when a gem has been collected. The player also has a particle trail which follows behind them as they fly through space.
